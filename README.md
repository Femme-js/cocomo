# COCOMO-II SIMULATOR
### COCOMO-II Simulator made by Prateek Jain in guidance with Prof. Syed Usman Ahmed Sir.

The Project is based on COCOMO-II simulator, which is used to estimate the cost of software
engineering. While software estimations may look straightforward in practice, but it is not in
real life. It allows us to estimate the cost, effort, and scheduling of new software. It will be
used by students, faculty members and lab assistants for college based projects. The
COCOMO-II software system estimates is a screen oriented, interactive program that assists in
budgetary planning and scheduling estimation of a software development project.
